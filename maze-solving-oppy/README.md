# maze-solving-oppy
Self-driving cars are popular in this day and age. I fancy the idea of programming a scaled down robot buggy that is automated to solve a possible scenario in real life. This project is about a robot that is programmed to drive itself in a maze, from an open end to the other. Several key algorithms and data structures are applied to make this project possible.
